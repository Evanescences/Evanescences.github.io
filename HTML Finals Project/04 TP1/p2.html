            <strong>Bus Purpose</strong>
            <p id="body">I/O (Input/Output) buses act as communication pathways connecting different
                parts of a computer system, enabling data exchange between the CPU, memory, peripherals, and other
                devices. They facilitate the transmission of signals, commands, and data among these components,
                ensuring smooth system operation.</p>

            <strong>Function</strong>
            <ul>
                <li><b>Data Transfer: </b></li>
                <p>- Enabling data movement among the CPU, memory, and peripheral devices like hard drives, USBs,
                    network cards, and expansion cards.
                </p>
                <li><b>Control Signals: </b></li>
                <p>- Sending control signals that manage connected devices, such as instructions to read from or write
                    to specific memory locations, start data transfers, or control power states.
                </p>
                <li><b>Addressing:</b></li>
                <p>- Allowing the CPU to identify and access memory locations and I/O devices using distinct addresses
                    or identifiers.</p>
                <li><b>Interrupt Handling:</b></li>
                <p>- Handling interrupt signals that notify the CPU of urgent events, like data arrivals or device
                    malfunctions, needing immediate action.</p>
            </ul>
        </div>
        <div class="third">
            <strong>Conclusion</strong>
            <p>Over the decades, I/O buses have undergone significant evolution, with each new generation bringing
                faster speeds, improved efficiency, and enhanced features. Since the early days of computing to today's
                modern systems, I/O buses remain crucial for facilitating communication and data transfer within
                computer systems. As technology progresses, the ongoing development of new bus technologies will further
                boost computer system performance and capabilities.</p>
