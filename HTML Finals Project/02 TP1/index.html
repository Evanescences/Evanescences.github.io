            <b>Abstract—</b>This paper contains a case study regarding a decision-making process within a
            semiconductor
            company about certain problem involving microprocessors. Keywords— microprocessor, faulty registers,
            business, reliability
        </p>
        <br><br>
        <strong>I. INTRODUCTION</strong>
        <p>Microprocessors are a crucial part of modern personal computers, combining the functions of a central
            processing unit onto a single integrated circuit. This circuit coordinates the machine's essential
            operations with the necessary electrical support. Selecting the right microprocessor is vital due to
            compatibility and performance considerations in any microcomputer system.</p>
        <br><br>
        <strong>II. SITUATION</strong>
        <p>As newly hired test engineers at a semiconductor company, your team is tasked with testing a new series of
            microprocessors, which will proceed to mass production upon management approval.</p>
        <br><br>
        <strong>III. CHALLENGES</strong>
        <p>
            • Your team found that 3 out of 10 microprocessors have faulty registers.
            <br>• The decision to release the new series of processors depends on your team's evaluation.
            <br>• Your team informed the supervisor about these issues.
        </p>
        <br><br>
        <strong>IV. STATEMENT OF THE PROBLEM</strong>
        <p>
            1. What problems could arise if the faulty microprocessors are released?
            <br>
            2. Which departments are responsible for this situation?
        </p>
        <br><br>
        <strong>V. OBJECTIVES</strong>
        <p>
            • Develop innovative approaches and solutions for the scenario.
            <br> • Identify processes in fabrication and design that can be improved.
        </p>
        <br><br>
        <strong>VI. ANALYSIS</strong>
        <p>
            Releasing defective products is ill-advised and neglectful, leading to negative consequences such as poor
            customer reviews and lower company ratings. Faulty products can cause consumer injuries or fail to perform
            as advertised, leading to returns, refunds, or replacements, which can result in minor financial losses. A
            poor reputation could lead to lost sales and investor trust, potentially resulting in lawsuits for violating
            consumer protection laws and product liability. The Production/Manufacturing Department and the Quality
            Management Team are responsible for ensuring product quality. The production department designs and
            manufactures goods, while the Quality Management Team oversees quality control and assurance, authorized to
            halt production if quality declines significantly.
        </p>
        <br><br>
        <strong>VII. CONCLUSION</strong>
        <p>
            We live in an age of global business and that means the average consumer has far more choice of who they
            do business with than ever before. As a result, a company needs to do all they can to stay ahead of the
            competition and that starts with reliability. An effective product reliability process requires a strong
            team, at every level. Turning your business into a trusted brand is a great way to build your customer
            base and boost your bottom line. If you always do what you say, customers will start to feel like you're
            a company they can trust, and this will make them more likely to shop with you in the future.
        </p>
        <br><br>
        <strong>VIII. RECOMMENDATION</strong>
        <p>
            1. Ensure product quality before market release.
            <br>2. Hire professionals dedicated to their work.
        </p>
