    <div><b>Architecture</b>
        <p class="body">
            • CISC (Complex Instruction Set Computer) architectures use complex instructions
            that perform multiple low-level operations, reducing program length but often requiring more clock cycles
            per instruction. <br><br>• RISC (Reduced Instruction Set Computer) architectures use simpler instructions
            that execute
            quickly, typically in a single clock cycle, improving speed and efficiency but potentially increasing
            program length. The choice between CISC and RISC affects performance, power consumption, and system
            complexity.
        </p>
        <p class="body">
            • x86: A CISC architecture, is used in desktops and servers for its powerful computation capabilities,
            but it consumes more power and generates more heat.
            <br><br>• ARM, a RISC architecture, is optimized for energy efficiency and simplicity, making it ideal for
            mobile devices and embedded systems with longer battery life and lower heat production.

        </p>
        <b>Application</b>
        <p class="body">
            • General-purpose processors, found in devices like PCs and servers, are designed for a wide range of
            applications, offering
            high performance and versatility. They support complex operating systems and multiple concurrent tasks, but
            they often consume more power and generate more heat.
            <br>
            <br>
            • Embedded processors, on the other hand, are tailored for specific control functions within larger systems,
            such as in appliances, vehicles, and industrial machines. They are optimized for efficiency, reliability,
            and cost-effectiveness, typically consuming less power and operating in real-time environments, but they
            have limited capabilities compared to general-purpose processors.
        </p>
        <b>Manufacturing Process</b>
        <p class="body">
            • High-performance processors are designed for maximum speed and processing power, suitable for demanding
            tasks such as gaming, video editing, and scientific computations. They typically consume more power and
            produce more heat, requiring robust cooling solutions.
            <br>
            <br>
            • Low-power processors prioritize energy efficiency and are used in devices like smartphones, tablets, and IoT
            devices. They extend battery life and reduce heat output but offer less processing power compared to
            high-performance processors. The choice between them depends on the specific application requirements,
            balancing speed and efficiency.
