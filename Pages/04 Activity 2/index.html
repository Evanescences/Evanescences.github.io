    <div class="body">
        <p id="ans"> Crosstalk from radio-frequency interference (RFI) refers to the unwanted electromagnetic signals
            that can interfere with nearby electronic devices or communication systems operating at similar frequencies.
            It occurs when signals from one circuit or system unintentionally couple into another nearby circuit or
            system. The impact of RFI can vary based on factors such as frequency, proximity, and shielding
            effectiveness.
<br><br>
            RFI can manifest in different ways: direct coupling, where signals travel through physical conductors or
            components; capacitive coupling, where electric fields induce unwanted signals; and inductive coupling,
            where magnetic fields induce signals in nearby conductors. Each type of coupling affects electronic systems
            differently: direct coupling can cause signal degradation or loss, while capacitive and inductive coupling
            can induce noise or distortion in signals.
<br><br>
            To mitigate RFI, shielding techniques like metallic enclosures or grounded conductive materials are used to
            block electromagnetic fields. Filtering components such as capacitors or inductors can also be employed to
            suppress unwanted frequencies. Moreover, careful circuit layout and separation of sensitive components can
            minimize the risk of crosstalk from RFI, ensuring reliable operation of electronic devices and communication
            systems in environments with high electromagnetic interference.</p>
