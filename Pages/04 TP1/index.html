            <strong>Year Developed</strong>
            <p>The concept of I/O buses began to take shape in the 1960s with the advent of early computing systems.
                However, specific bus technologies have been developed and refined over time. For example:</p>
            <br>
                <ul>
                <li><b>ISA (Industry Standard Architecture) bus:</b></li>
                <p>- Developed in the early 1980s.</p>
                <li><b>PCI (Peripheral Component Interconnect) bus:</b></li>
                <p>- Developed in the early 1990s.</p>
                <li><b>USB (Universal Serial Bus):</b></li>
                <p>- Developed in the mid-1990s.</p>
                <li><b>PCIe (Peripheral Component Interconnect Express):</b></li>
                <p>- Developed in the early 2000s.</p>
            </ul>
        </div>
        <div class="second">
            <strong>Speed</strong>
            <p>Speeds vary significantly depending on the specific bus technology and generation. For instance:</p>
            <br>
            <ul>
                <li><b>ISA:</b></li>
                <p>- Typically operated at speeds of around 8-10 megabytes per second (MB/s).</p>
                <li><b>PCI:</b></li>
                <p>- Initially operated at speeds of 133 megabytes per second (MB/s) with later versions offering faster
                    speeds.</p>
                <li><b>USB:</b></li>
                <p>- USB 1.0 had a maximum data transfer rate of 12 megabits per second (Mbps), while USB 3.2 offers
                    speeds of up to 20 gigabits per second (Gbps).</p>
                <li><b>PCIe:</b></li>
                <p>- Speeds vary depending on the generation and configuration, with PCIe 4.0 offering speeds of up to
                    16 gigatransfers per second (GT/s) per lane.</p>
            </ul>
        </div>
        <div class="third">
            <strong>Voltage Used</strong>
            <p>Voltage requirements can vary depending on the design and specifications of the bus. For example:</p>
            <br>
            <ul>
                <li><b>ISA:</b></li>
                <p>- Typically operated at 5 volts.</p>
                <li><b>PCI:</b></li>
                <p>- Operated at 3.3 volts or 5 volts.</p>
                <li><b>USB:</b></li>
                <p>- Operated at 5 volts.</p>
                <li><b>PCIe:</b></li>
                <p>- Operated at various voltages, including 3.3 volts and 12 volts.</p>
            </ul>
